INTRODUCTION                                    *cheatsheet*

This plugin allows you to specify buffer-specific content that can be shown in
a popup window when toggled.

The motivating use case is Makefiles where "$^" and "$<" look similar but have
an important difference between them.  "$^" contains every prerequisite of a
recipe while "$<" contains only the first prerequisite.  It is very easy to
forget which is which, so we can put this information in a popup window that we
can activate when we need it:
>
  augroup cheatsheet
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType make
                \ let b:cheatsheet_title = "Makefile reminders" |
                \ let b:cheatsheet_lines = [
                \   "$<  first prerequisite",
                \   "$^  all prerequisites",
                \ ]
  augroup END

MAPPINGS                                        *cheatsheet-mappings*

By default, the cheatsheet toggle is mapped to <Leader>C.  You can change this
mapping by setting 'g:cheatsheet_no_mappings' in your '.vimrc' and mapping
<Plug>ToggleCheatsheet to a different key combination:
>
  let g:cheatsheet_no_mappings = v:true

  " Bind the toggle to `g?` instead:
  nmap <silent> g? <Plug>ToggleCheatsheet
